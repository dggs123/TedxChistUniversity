                    He is a graphic designer as well as a video editor but his passion lies in making music. The
                    physics behind tracks got his curiosity up and running and gave him the drive to explore different

                    schooling, sharpening his skills to become a successful recording artist who is now supported by
                    various national and international blogs such as The Rolling Stone and Dancing Astronaut. <br>
